# Predict-The-Flight-Ticket-Price
Nowadays, the number of people using flights has increased significantly. It is difficult for
airlines to maintain prices due to complexity of the algorithm to calculate flight prices under
various conditions. That’s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This
can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help customers to
predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.
